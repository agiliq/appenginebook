How the book is organised?
-----------------------------

The book targets experienced developers, as a result we do not spend a lot of
time on basic stuff. What has been covered earlier is linked to, instead of
explaining again. For example, we do not spend a lot of time explaining how to
install things, instead linking to Google's official documentation.

In Chapter 1, we write the simplest appengine application, explaining app.yaml
and other cruft needed to get things to work.

In chapter 2, we build a link shortener, explaining the templating system in the
process.

In Chapter 3, we build a pastebin, explaining the Datastore in the process.

In Chapter 4, we build a basic blog, explaining the User system in the process.

In chapter 5, we build a twitter mashup, explaing the Urlfetch, mail and other
services.

In chapter 6, we build a twitter clone using Django, explaining how to use
Django on appengine.
