Introduction

Google Appengine is a cloud computing environment offered by Google. Initially
with Python and now JVM support it provides an instantly deployable and (in
theory at least) infinitely scalable system. In this book, you will learn how to
build web application using this new system.

With Appengine, you are provided,

1. A (Python or JVM) runtime.
2. A Datastore (Which is a replacement for database)
3. A web framework. (And you can use Django and other frameworks, if you wish)
4. Other needed services like Urlfetch(to access remote sites), mail, user
system(which ties to google accounts) and memcached.

What you don't get,

1. Your runtime is constrained. System calls dont work. You cant use threading.
urllib and mail have appengine specific replacements.
2. The Datastore is not a Database. You can not use joins. (But we will see ways
to work around that)
