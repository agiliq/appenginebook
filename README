This is a project to write an open source Google Appengine Book. The intended audience
already knows Python and maybe a little web development.

The style of this book is a mixture of Dive Into Python and Practical Django Projects,
where we write the code and explain it. We build useful apps on appengine, moving from very simpl
to full fledged, to teach Appengine.
